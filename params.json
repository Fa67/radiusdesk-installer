As of the time of this writing, Python 3 is not supported by Ansible so please take note. [Managed Node Requirements](http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/intro_installation.html#managed-node-requirements)\r\n\r\nTo Install Python which should come by default in most Linux distributions, you can use your package manager:\r\n\r\n**RHEL/CentOS 6.x/7.x**\r\n\r\n`yum install -y python`\r\n\r\n**Ubuntu 14.x/15.x**\r\n\r\n`apt-get install -y python`\r\n\r\n#### 2] Install Ansible 1.9+\r\nRADIUSDesk Installer utilizes the latest version of Ansible and for this you must ensure you have at least **Ansible 1.9** and above for the Installer to work as intended.\r\n\r\nTo Install Ansible, use your package manager and if your distribution comes with an older version of Ansible check the following steps to install the latest Ansible package:\r\n\r\n**RHEL/CentOS 6.x/7.x**\r\n\r\n```\r\nyum install -y epel-release\r\nyum install -y ansible\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n**Note:** To Manually install EPEL repositories, Visit the [EPEL Wiki](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/EPEL) \r\n\r\n\r\n**Ubuntu 14.x/15.x**\r\n\r\n```\r\napt-get install -y software-properties-common python-software-properties\r\napt-add-repository ppa:ansible/ansible\r\napt-get update\r\napt-get install -y ansible\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### 3] Add Managed Node(s) to SSH Known Hosts list of the Conrol Node\r\nSSH into the local/remote managed node/server at least once to ensure it is added to the control node/server SSH **known_host** file.\r\n\r\n`ssh root@localhost` or `ssh root@192.168.23.101`\r\n\r\n## Using RADIUSDesk Installer\r\n#### Clone the Installer from [GitHub](https://github.com/muffycompo/radiusdesk-installer)\r\n\r\n`git clone https://github.com/muffycompo/radiusdesk-installer`\r\n\r\n**Note:** If you don't have git installed, make sure you so before cloning the Installer. Use your package manager to install git; `yum install -y git` on RHEL/CentOS or `apt-get install -y git` on Ubuntu.\r\n\r\n#### Run the Installer\r\n1.\tBy default, the installer will setup RADIUSDesk on the server you are currently running the installer from i.e. `localhost`. To change that and use a remote server (on your network or in the cloud), edit the **`servers`** file in the installer's directory; `cd radiusdesk-installer; vi servers`. You can create a new host group as per [Ansible's guide](http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/intro_inventory.html#hosts-and-groups) or modify the sample groups in the **`servers`** file. If you have modified the **`servers`** file and created a new group, also remember to edit the ** `rd-installer-ansible.yml` ** and ensure the hosts uses your newly created server group from the previous step.\r\n\r\n2.\tRADIUSDesk Installer requires root privileges to ensure it installs packages and configure your servers properly. Login as the **`root`** user or a user with sudo privileges. Run the installer and select ** I ** or ** 1 ** to start provisioning your server with RADIUSDesk.\r\n`cd radiusdesk-installer; ./rd-installer`\r\n\r\n3. Grab yourself a **cup of Coffee** as the installer provisions your server with RADIUSDesk and reboot the server to ensure everything is persistent on reboot **[Optional]**.\r\n\r\n## Video Walkthrough\r\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/VedzdhcBD5A\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\r\n\r\n## Features\r\n1. A very customizable installer (Edit `roles/radiusdesk/vars/Debian.yml` or `roles/radiusdesk/vars/RedHat.yml` depending on your Operating System family like Debian, RedHat etc). **Note:** ensure you use a YAML linter to check your syntax anytime you make any change to the variable file(s).\r\n\r\n2. Somewhat modularized, so you can always extend RADIUSDesk installer to support your environment\r\n\r\n3. Support for PPTPD **[Optional]**\r\n\r\n4. Support for CoovaChilli Captive portal **[Optional]**\r\n\r\n5. Support for Dynamic Login Pages **[Optional]**\r\n\r\n## Compatibility\r\n1.\t** Ansible 1.9+ **\r\n2.\tThe installer has been tested on the following Linux Operating Systems:\r\n\t\r\n    - ** RHEL/CentOS 6.5/6.7 (32/64 bit) **\r\n    - ** Ubuntu 14.04/15.04/15.10 (32/64 bit) **    \r\n\r\n## Resources\r\n1.
