The Installer utilizes Ansible's powerful features like agentless modes, idempotent runs etc.\r\n\r\n## Installation & Usage\r\n1. Clone or download the project.\r\n\r\n   a) If you have git already installed, just use `git clone https://github.com/muffycompo/radiusdesk-installer.git`. **Note:** you can install git on RHEL/CentOS 6.x via yum (`yum install -y git`) or Ubuntu via apt (`apt-get install -y git`)\r\n   \r\n   b) If you prefer to download the zip file `wget -cL https://github.com/muffycompo/radiusdesk-installer/archive/master.zip`. **Note:** just make sure you have **wget** and **unzip** installed using (`yum install -y wget unzip`) on RHEL/CentOS 6.x and (`apt-get install -y wget unzip`) on Ubuntu servers.\r\n   \r\n   c) Ensure you have installed python as Ansible requires python to run.\r\n   **Note:** you can install python on RHEL/CentOS 6.x via yum (`yum install -y python`) or Ubuntu via apt (`apt-get install -y python`).\r\n   \r\n   d) SSH into the local/remote server atleast once to have SSH add an entry in its `known_hosts` file. i.e. `ssh localhost` or `ssh 192.168.23.101`\r\n   \r\n   e) Edit the `servers` if you want to customize your server groups. Reference: `http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/intro_inventory.html#hosts-and-groups`\r\n   \r\n2. Run/execute the Installer as **root** or a user with sudo privileges `cd radiusdesk-installer; ./rd-installer` and select I or 1 to commence the installation of RADIUSDesk using default values.\r\n3. Grab yourself a **cup of Coffee** as the installer provisions your server with RADIUSDesk.\r\n\r\n4. When the installer is done installing and configuring your system, we recommend rebooting your machine/server to ensure everything is persistent on reboot.\r\n\r\n## Features\r\n1. A very customizable installer (Edit `roles/radiusdesk/vars/Debian.yml` or `roles/radiusdesk/vars/RedHat.yml` depending on your Operating System family like Debian, RedHat etc). **Note:** ensure you use a YAML linter to check your syntax anytime you make any change to the variable file(s).\r\n\r\n2. Somewhat modularized, so you can always extend RADIUSDesk installer to support your environment\r\n\r\n3. Setup PPTPD (Optional)\r\n\r\n4. Setup Captive Portal with CoovaChilli (Optional)\r\n\r\n## Compatibility\r\nThe installer has been tested on the following Linux Operating Systems\r\n \r\n1. CentOS 6.5/6.7 (32/64 bit)\r\n2. Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.5/6.7 (32/64 bit) \r\n3. Ubuntu 14.04/15.04/15.10 (32/64 bit) \r\n\r\n## Resources\r\n1.
